# Fix Applied - Build Dependencies Moved âœ…

## Problem Fixed
The build was failing because `vite` and `esbuild` were in devDependencies, but Render needs them as regular dependencies to build the project.

## Solution Applied
I've moved these essential build tools to dependencies:
- âœ… `vite` - Build tool
- âœ… `esbuild` - Server bundler  
- âœ… `typescript` - TypeScript compiler
- âœ… `@vitejs/plugin-react` - React plugin
- âœ… `autoprefixer` - CSS processing
- âœ… `postcss` - CSS processing
- âœ… `tailwindcss` - CSS framework

## Build Test Results
âœ… **Local build successful** - Generated:
- `dist/public/index.html` (1.86 kB)
- `dist/public/assets/index-Hb7O4t64.css` (88.99 kB)
- `dist/public/assets/index-CXr9_Bnm.js` (485.79 kB)  
- `dist/index.js` (19.5 kB)

## Next Steps for Render Deployment

### 1. Update Your GitHub Repository
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Move build dependencies to production dependencies for Render"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Render Will Auto-Deploy
- Render will automatically detect the changes
- Build should now succeed with the moved dependencies
- Your site will be live at: `https://buildiofy-website.onrender.com`

### 3. Monitor the Build
- Check Render dashboard for build progress
- Build logs should show successful compilation
- Test the live site and contact form

## Expected Render Build Output
```
==> Running build command 'npm install && npm run build'...
âœ“ Dependencies installed successfully
âœ“ Frontend built with Vite
âœ“ Backend bundled with esbuild
==> Build succeeded ðŸŽ‰
==> Deploy succeeded ðŸš€
```

Your Buildiofy website is now ready for successful Render deployment!
